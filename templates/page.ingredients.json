The epigenome, a complex molecular framework enveloping DNA, dictates gene activation or repression. With advancing age, epigenomic dysregulation emerges—genes that should remain silent awaken, while essential genes like those safeguarding against cancer become dormant. This epigenetic upheaval significantly contributes to aging.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Integral to this epigenetic orchestration is the TET enzyme (ten eleven translocation), pivotal in reverting the epigenome to a more youthful state. Optimal TET functionality hinges upon alpha-ketoglutarate, alongside the assistance of vitamin C.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Alpha-ketoglutarate intersects carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, a convergence increasingly impaired with age. This compound aids cellular sustenance of metabolic adaptability between carbohydrates and amino acids, preserving this flexibility for an extended duration.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Moreover, alpha-ketoglutarate bolsters mitochondrial well-being—a logical extension, considering its role as a mitochondrial energy source. It catalyzes AMPK activation, a pivotal switch governing both metabolism and longevity.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>Furthermore, alpha-ketoglutarate partakes in detoxification. Specifically, it aids in the elimination of ammonia—a by product of protein metabolism, which accumulates with increased protein consumption. As aging progresses, ammonia removal becomes less efficient, and alpha-ketoglutarate contributes significantly to detoxifying the body from excess ammonium, counteracting potential toxicity.<\/strong><\/p>","page":""}},"cd57b661-382d-4dbf-ab49-cb85873a0b70":{"type":"question","settings":{"heading":"GLYCINE","content":"<p><strong>Restricting calories, branched-chain amino acids, and methionine have demonstrated the ability to increase the lifespan of model organisms.
